# 📖 PageSync  
*A Page Ratio Calculator*  

PageSync is a simple yet useful calculator that helps you determine the equivalent page number in a different book based on total pages. Whether you're switching between editions, formats, or just want to track your reading progress across different versions, PageSync makes it easy.  

## 🎯 Features  
- Convert page numbers between books with different total pages.  
- Minimal and intuitive UI for quick calculations.  
- No unnecessary complexity—just enter the numbers and get your result.  

## 🛠️ How It Works  
1. Enter the **current page** and **total pages** of your current book.  
2. Enter the **total pages** of the new book.  
3. Click **"Get Current Page"** to see the equivalent page in the new book.  

## 🚀 Why I Made This  
I created PageSync just for fun and because I personally needed a tool to sync my reading progress between different book editions. If you find it useful too, feel free to use it! 😃
